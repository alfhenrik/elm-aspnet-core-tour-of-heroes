# Tutorial: Tour Of Heroes

This Tour of Heroes tutorial takes you through the steps of creating an Elm application (with an ASP.NET Core backend eventually).

## Getting started

### Clone the repo

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/alfhenrik/elm-aspnet-core-tour-of-heroes.git
```

### Install all the things

First install the `yarn` package manager using their [installation guide](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install), then run the following commands:

``` bash
cd elm-aspnet-core-tour-of-heroes/src/elm-aspnet-core-tour-of-heroes-app
yarn install
```

Start the application:

``` bash
yarn client
```

This will start the webpack dev server and serve the site on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
